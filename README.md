# Welcome to the ogon (core) repository

The ogon repository is part of the ogon project and contains the code of the
RDP server and session manager as well as protocol descriptions and some command line
(helper) utilities.

## What is the ogon project?

The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and tools mainly written in C/C++
that provide graphical remote access to Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). It supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs, dis- and
reconnection to sessions and device redirections.
ogon is compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.

Any X11 destkop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to it's modular
design it's easily possible to extend or add features or add new backends.
