/**

*
* @brief Factory implementation class using c++ templates.
*
* This class implements the Factory pattern. Therefor c++ templating was used.
*
* Factory pattern: 
*
* Factory Method is a creational pattern. This pattern helps to model an interface for creating an object 
* which at creation time can let its subclasses decide which class to instantiate. We call this a Factory Pattern
* since it is responsible for "Manufacturing" an Object. It helps instantiate the appropriate Subclass by creating the 
* right Object from a group of related classes. The Factory Pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to 
* bind application-specific classes into the code. 
*
* Factories have a simple function: Churn out objects.
*
* Obviously, a factory is not needed to make an object. A simple call to new will do it for you. However, 
* the use of factories gives the programmer the opportunity to abstract the specific attributes of an Object 
* into specific subclasses which create them.
*
* The Factory Pattern is all about "Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which 
* class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses" Thus, as defined by 
* the baseclass et al, "The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses".

* class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses" Thus, as defined by 
* the baseclass et al, "The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses".
*
* To use this factory template you have to do following steps:
* - Implment factory using the template (ConnectionFactory)
* - Create baseclass for containing classes (ConnectionBase)
* - Implement spezific class (Connection1)
* - Use factory
*
* Remarks:
*
* In this example the Factory implementation is also a singleton. Therefor the macro <code>CONNECTION_FACTORY</code> is 
* used to get the one and only instance of the connectionFactory class.
* 
* Implment factory using the template:
*
* @code
#include "FactoryBase.h"
#include "ConnectionBase.h"

#include <string>

#define CONNECTION_FACTORY ConnectionFactory::instance()

class ConnectionFactory :public FactoryBase<ConnectionBase,std::string> {

};	
*
* @endcode
*
* Create baseclass for containing classes:
*
* @code
#include <string>


class ConnectionBase {

public:
virtual std::string getDescription() = 0;

};
* @endcode
*
* Implement spezific class:
*
* @code
#include "String.h"
#include "ConnectionBase.h"
#include "ConnectionFactory.h"


class Connection1 : public ConnectionBase
{
public:
std::string getDescription();
private:
};

FACTORY_REGISTER(ConnectionFactory,Connection1)

* @endcode
*
* Use factory:
*
* @code
ConnectionBase * con = CONNECTION_FACTORY.createClass("Connection1");
* @endcode
*
* @see FACTORY_REGISTER
* @see SingletonBase
